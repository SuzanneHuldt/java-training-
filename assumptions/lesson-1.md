##lesson 1 - hello world

The first java lesson is going to be hello-world - classique. 
I've chosen this because writing code is easy, and developing software is hard - this lesson will take us through each step required to get to the point where we can
1) write and 2) actually observe the behaviour of some java code.

The file contents below are my 'field notes', cataloguing assumptions and questions, and 
reassessment of assumptions in the face of what happens with the code. The entries are 'order stamped' so you can follow along with the (rough) linearity of my thought process.


###EDIT 1

####what is java's environment - and what does 'environment' mean anyway?

java is a language and a language must be understood, somewhere by some entity, or they override
the necessary condition of their definition.

java, like other programming languages, is interesting, because it is understood by both
human beings and machines, but in different ways. java as written is optimised for human
comprehension. therefore, java as understood by the machine must - following the assumption
that humans and machines think differently - be somehow transformed or reinterpreted from 
its written form, which as stated we assume is suboptimal for machine understanding.

####how is this done?

we begin with the assumption that java has as its most 'high level' (in its sense of 'human proximate')
instantiation as java code that is written to a text file and then saved within a directory
that itself is a list of files all sharing identical penultimate address locations before their terminal node.

####what do we need to make available to the java code in order that the instructions contained therein can be understood by the machine?
