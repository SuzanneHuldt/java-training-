# java-training-

Welcome to the java training repo, where we learn java together - somehow!

I want to focus on learning the language for use at work - both in terms of syntax, and the
practicalities of libraries and frameworks (like spring) commonly use with java.

I also want to take the time and space to give thought to the underlying computational
underpinnings of java - what type of language is it? how is it executed? what is the relationship
between java in particular as a high level language with the computer - and what can 
we learn from it in general about the status of the high level language within the computer?

This is more than an intellctual exercise to me - rather, I want to take this opportunity
to learn these things as I hope it will make me (us) more powerful at the business of  engineering
and thinking about architecures.

Here's how it works:

Periodically, I will upload a file, about some feature of java. In this file will be a sketch
outline of the feautre, my assumptions about how and why it works in the way it does, and
some output or behaviour of some code. 

You will try to reproduce my output(s) and keep your own note file with your assumptions
about i/o relationships and behaviour. Push your code and your notes file to the repo, and I'll push my code and we'll compare notes :)
